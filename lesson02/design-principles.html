                <p>The Church of Jesus Christ does a good job with Hick's Law. On the first page you see four main choices.
                    These open bigger tabs to select choices from. They help narrow down the selection of what you are looking for.
                    When you aren't sure what you are trying to find the four main tabs help narrow it down. You can guess which tab it will
                    be in. Once inside these tabs it is easy to find what you are looking for. When you search you can expand or narrow down what
                    you are looking at from talks to scriptures.

                    you follow along as you scroll down. On the right hand side are the similar listings. Those catch your

                    This is the proximity of objeccts to denote what paragrapghs go to what subtitle or picture. When we look
                    at the speeches byu page we see this in action. The subtitles with the rotating talks with the pictures lets
                    you see what talks the subtitles describe. Within these little boxes the pictures go with the talks as you
                    see a border to contain what all is with that certain talk. This all helps you navigate the page knowing what
                    you are looking for that the helpers like titles show you where you may find them.
