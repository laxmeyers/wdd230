            <h2>Meridian Idaho Temple</h2>
            <div><img src="images/meridian.jpg" alt="meridian temple" id="meridian"></div>
            <p>On December 19, 2011, the church's announced that the Meridian Idaho Temple would be constructed at 7345
                North Linder Road. This location is a few blocks north of the intersection of North Linder Road and
                Chinden Blvd.<span id="more"><br><br>

                    David A. Bednar, of the church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, presided at the temple's
                    groundbreaking
                    on August 23, 2014. A public open house was held from October 21 through November 11, 2017. The
                    temple was dedicated on November 19, 2017 by Dieter F. Uchtdorf.
                    The temple's design incorporates seismic standards above the code requirements, including its
                    exterior<br><br>
                    cladding. The cladding is connected to the steel frame so that it discharges energy through a
                    rocking
                    motion and acts like a buffer in the event of an earthquake. The temple interior includes marble
                    quarried from Egypt, Italy, and Spain. According to the church, the temple's design includes the
                    syringa (Idaho' state flower) and golds, blues and greens in the wool rugs and stained glass,
                    reflecting
                    Idaho harvest and nature.

            <h2>Chicago Illinois Temple</h2>
            <div><img src="images/illinois.jpg" alt="Chicago Illinois temple" id="illinois"></div>
            <p>Located in the Chicago suburb of Glenview, the site of Chicago Illinois Temple was dedicated on August
                13, 1983 by Gordon B. Hinckley, a member of the church's First Presidency. The structure itself was
                constructed in gray buff marble and its roof features gray slate. Architects used a revolutionary design
                for LDS temples, adapting the traditional six-spire design and adding modern motifs.<span id="more2"><br><br>

                The construction of the temple faced some pushback from the community due to environmental concerns.
                Construction was eventually able to proceed. Construction of the temple also allowed local Latter-day
                Saints to contribute their means, talents, and time. This included children donating pennies, young
                women making dolls for the temple nursery, and women crocheting and tatting altar cloths. Many hours
                were donated in helping with the public open house, held July 15 â€“ August 3, 1985, during which over one
                hundred thousand people toured the temple. Hinckley dedicated the temple on August 9, 1985.<br><br>

                Four years after the dedication, the temple was closed and expanded that more than doubled its size. The
                temple now has a total of 37,062 square feet (3,443.2 m2), five ordinance rooms, and three sealing
                rooms.<br><br>

                On December 24, 2008, a frozen sprinkler pipe burst in the ceiling, with water-damaged furniture, carpet
                and wood trim that all had to be replaced.<span id="dots2">...</span></span></p>
