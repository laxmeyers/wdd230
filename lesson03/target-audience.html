                Farnsworth grew up in this town. When it was first really all just farmland. With the expansion of the
                residential areas in his town he wanted to do realistate. He saw an opportunity to make money and he
                knew the place better than any other realitors in the area. He went to college for business and came out

            <h3>Abigail Blotwells</h3>
            <p> Loooking for a job in another city.<br>
                Abigail was let go recently from her job in Montana. She has been in Montana 23 years and was wanting a
                change. She isn't married and stills wants to be married. Can't seem to find the right guy. Thought a
                different state would be a good change to find someone else. She was a live in nanny for a family back
                in Montana. Looking to find a live in nanny position or any job really. Wants to make connections and
                further her education.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Goals:</strong></p>
            <li>Find a nice man to marry</li>
            <li>Increase her education</li>
            <li>figure out what to do with her life</li>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Background</strong><br>
                Abigail says she is from Florida, as that is where she was born. Her family moved to Montana when her
                dad got a job offer as a mechanical engineer. They lived there the whole time since. Abigail likes to
                sound more interesting and thus why she says she is from Florida. When she graduated from high school
                she went to colledge for about 3 weeks before dropping out and taking the live in nanny for a couple
                with 3 younger kids that had moved into her home town in Montana. She regrets leaving college and taking
                the job but thought this would be best for her. Never figured out what to do with her life.
